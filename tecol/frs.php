We offer financial valuations and investment consulting.  Our analysts prepare in-depth market and company reports. We employ various  valuation methods and develop recommendations for medium- to long-term  investment strategies.</p><br>
<p>At Forseti Consult we provide  financial valuations and investment consulting for our clients. Our team is  committed to high performance standards and client satisfaction.</p><br>
<p>We specialize in providing  fundamental analyses for markets and individual companies. Based on these  analyses and with regard to various models (DDM, FCF, FCE) we create financial  valuations of individual public companies or assets.</p><br>
<p>A main concern in our analytical  framework is macroeconomic development. While companies are individual  entities, their performance is still linked to the overall economy. This is  especially true for large companies traded on stock exchanges. The volatility  in markets impacts shares either through HFT or by sector associations.  Economic policies and instruments employed to achieve development, bank lending  practices and consumer income structure largely describe the business  environment.</p><br>
<p>With this in mind, we assess the  market sector and technological solutions applied by individual businesses and  we so establish the future growth options and the presence of competitive  advantage. Starting with such fundamental analyses our teams explore technical  indicators, cash-flow and off-balance liabilities to derive overall conclusions  about the fare value of a company's shares.</p><br>
<p>Our  analysts look in 3- to 5-year horizons to support our clients' longer-term  investments in the completion of their full business cycle.</p>                    </section>
