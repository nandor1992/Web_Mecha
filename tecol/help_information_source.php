				<p>The general idea of TECoL is to support its User to achieve a rate of objectivity of his/her insights regarding the possibility of cartel structures functioning in a certain market segment. This is supposed to be performed by combining specific characteristics of the pointed segment assuming that every characteristic by itself can be caused by a random reason that is not connected with collusion but the combination of them the further it goes more hardly it becomes to be due to anything else but a cartel. Of course, to draw the characteristics in question, the reliability of primary information is crucial. </p></br>
				<p>Therefore the value of the different sources of information is estimated according to their ability to provide reliable objective information. </p></br>
				<p> At the same time the uniqueness of TECoL comes from the accent it puts on the interaction between scientifically developed Economical Models based on information obtained from official sources – Statistics, Trade Registers, Patent Buroes etc. and the variety of formal and informal information collected and stored by a practitioner in a certain industry that is supposed to be the case with our perspective User. His information is not to be underestimated in any way. Just its evaluation will put the responsibility for the final result of the TECoL Process on its reliability.</p></br>
				<p> Having in mind that the User is neither an experienced scientist nor a person specially trained to deal with digitalized information we arrange and evaluate the sources according to their accessibility and the range of the data they can provide. </p></br>
				<p>So, the sources of information presupposed in creating the TECoL, arranged by reliability/objectivity and accessibility/information power are: </p>
				<p><b>Official Public Information</b></p>
				<ol>
				<li><p>Statistic Offices. Among them the most convenient turned out to be Eurostat – the Statistical Office of the European Commission. For most of the markers included in TECoL its information is sufficiently detailed and moreover it presents the data for the European countries in the same database i.e. simultaneously. The system of National Statistics sometimes can supply more detailed and more diversified data and upon request or for a fixed fee can deliver data that are not included in the regular releases.</p></li></br>
				<li><p>Annual Reports. These are the reports mandatory to be submitted and published in the Business Registers by most companies in the respective country.</p></li></br>
				<li><p>Patent Buroes. These are sources that can be useful for the field of innovativeness – an important aspect of detecting cartels. But to use it directly is quite an entangled procedure so we advise to be used the Patent Statistics data released by the Statistic Offices </p></li></br>
				</ol>
				<p><b>Proxies</b></p>
				<p>This is an aspect of the statistic information operation. The Statistics Offices have their own rules that quite often (and quite reasonably) restrict the access to information. Especially for the needs of the TECoL dealing with narrow market segments the Disclosure Prohibition and the Reliability Requirement are shutting down many of the data needed. Then our User has to face two options – no information or approximate information. For example in many cases the Market Shares of the main players are not to be found or calculated. It is far from being the same thing but some information can be found by using proxies. For example the market could in some cases be defined not by all of the market participants but by the market leaders (please see market leaders methodology). </p></br>
				<p><b> Information collected and stored by the User</b></p>
				<ol>
				<li><p>Information officially collected by non-governmental organizations – Chambers of Commerce, Trade Associations, Trade Unions, Consumer Rights Organizations etc. This is information seldom to be released but the assumption is that being well experienced in the respective business our User can have access to it and although not objective to the extent of Statistics or Annual Reports it can compensate with details and actuality.</p></li></br>
				<li><p>Information not officially collected but well known within the respective business, especially by the officials of the organizations representing it. </p></li></br>
				<li><p>
				Information “distilled” through the experience of the User:
				<ol type="a">
				<li><p>during the time when he/she was/is participating in one of the organizations representing the business under question</p></li>
				<li><p> being one of the producers/clients in the respective market segment for an amount of time</p></li>
				</ol>
				</p></li></br>
				</ol>
				<p> Of course, this is only a frame, a skeleton that, when filled with the flesh and blood of the real life, can turn out to be hollow in certain sections and insufficient in others but this is the problem with every model and it cannot be avoided. </p>
