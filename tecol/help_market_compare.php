				<p>TECoL is not meant to be a tool for detecting collusive behavior of a given company, a group of companies. The idea is to provide a certain level of objectivity for the personal insight of its User as to the chances that THE MARKET SEGMENT is behaving normally or “collusively”. It is THE MARKET SEGMENT, not the company, or the group of companies that is tested through TECoL Processes.</p></br>
				<p>This obvious characteristic makes the market segment COMPARISONS crucial. The most logical way to come to the conclusion whether a market segment is behaving normally or there are some strange performances is to compare it with other market segments and detect the trend. </p></br>
				<p>The question is what types of comparisons are supposed to be the most successful in the process of market diagnosis. There are several types of comparative areas.</p></br>
				<b>Horizontal</b>
				<ol type="A">
				<li>When one and the same market segment is scrutinized in different countries. Production of cheese should not be very different in Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Cyprus. If the characteristics of the Cheese Production in Romania differ substantially then it should be clarified why.
				<ol type="a">
				<li>Normally, the market segments compared internationally, should be in countries with comparable level of industrial development, purchasing power, technological and innovation saturation. And not to forget the traditions, customs, national patterns etc.</li>
				<li>But it is not always the case. And here comes you Dear User. Due to your experience, due to the hardships passed and successes achieved you are much more knowledgeable than any Model-designer which countries are really comparable regarding the specific market he wants to test.</li>
				<li>The diversification of the Regional and Local Markets makes your role Dear User as a designer of the compared areas much more prominent</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>When a market segment is compared with similar segments on the National Market. For example, really, the “Processing and preserving of meat” and “Processing and preserving of poultry meat” in the same country should not differ drastically.
				<ol type="a">
				<li>But again, it is you Dear Users who is supposed to have had painful experience with those things and you know better if there is any resemblance between for example meat and poultry meat.</li>
				<li>Moreover if it is Regional or Local Market that is to be compared.</li>				
				</ol>
				</li>
				</ol>
				</br>
				<p><b>Vertical</b>-at the level of aggregation. This is most clearly defined with the digits of NACE Rev.2 
				<a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-RA-07-015/EN/KS-RA-07-015-EN.PDF">Eurostat Classification of the industries.</a></p>
				<ol type="A">
				<li>2.1	Here special attention is needed not to jump from Production of Cement, for example, to Manufacturing as long as Production of IT Equipment and Pharmaceutical Products are also parts of Manufacturing and to compare the innovation rate in Production of Cement and something that contains Production of IT is a risky job. Really comparable levels should be looked for – one or maximum two digits should be the difference between the sections compared.</li>
				<li>2.2	This is possible to be done at international level but the approximations start to be quite large and if it is going to be done it is better to compare the comparisons between the narrow and larger segments in the respective countries.</li>
				<li>2.3	On the contrary, the Regional and Local Markets should make it much more clear for a practitioner what branches are comparable in the Vlaams Region and what branches – not.</li>
