				<p>In fact there are three levels where we consider TECoL effective.</p>
				<ol>
				<li><b>National</b></li>
				<li><b>Regional</b></li>
				<li><b>Local</b></li>
				</ol></br>
				<p>How we define the levels? The National Market level will hardly present any difficulties as a definition. All the enterprises functioning on the territory of a given country and whose production is sold on a market that is multiregional are forming the base of the National Market. For the Regional and Local markets the NUTS classification of Eurostat provides a solid definition base. The economical territory of EU is divided at three different levels – NUTS 1, 2 and 3. They contain respectively – 97, 270 and 1294 regions. NUTS 3 in fact represents the big towns with the territory ascribed to them.</p>
				<p>There are certain advantages to stick to the NUTS Classification:</p>
				<ol>
				<li><p>It really represents the regional and local structure of the National Markets</p></li>
				<li><p>It is developed using the respectful experience of the European Statistical Offices</p></li>
				<li><p>Looking for data it is more probable to find something at levels used by the European Statistics</p></li>
				<li><p>Requesting data it will be much more clear what exactly we are asking about if we work with a classification that is very well familiar to the Statistical Offices.</p></li>
				</ol></br>
				
				<p>Having the NUTS Classifications at hand the TECoL User will find it much easier to define what type of market he is interested in. The important thing is when defining the market to look at it from economical, not geographical point of view. Of course, it is important where an enterprise’s production units are situated but the real measure is where and how the enterprise (or local unit) it supplies its production. </p></br>
				<p>Speaking about types of markets it will hardly be too much if we underline once again one of the basic characteristic of TECoL Processes and the data they need to produce results. The more specified a market segment is – Regional, Local and the higher the levels of detailed data it requires, the more difficult it is to be obtained from the Statistical Offices. But, at the same time, with the growing specification and detailed data needed, the more relevant starts to be the User’s “own” information. And the lower level of objectivity is compensated with the higher level of practical sharpness and pragmatic edge that the experienced User can provide.</p>
