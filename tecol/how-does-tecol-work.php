                    <p>The project&rsquo;s theoretical base is the  anti-trust application of the Nobel-prize winning mathematical theory – it is a  model that predicts the probable market behavior of one or several companies in  a free market environment, and reacts if there is a huge discrepancy between  the theoretical likely behavior of the market participants and the actual one.  If there is a huge discrepancy in the behavior of the market participants there  are basis to assume that the participants in the market have illegally formed a  cartel.</p><br>
                    <p>Using over-simplification we can compare TECoL  to a very elaborate web base calculator. It will ask for information from YOU and  will come up with a mathematically backed assumption about possible cartel  existence.</p><br>
                    <p class="text-left">Here is how it will work:<br>
                      The tool will ask for information from the  user by something close to an on-line survey form.<br>
                      For example: <br>
                      Coming November 2014</p><br>
                    <p>The tool will provide a tip – hint or  guidance to where you might be able to find the corresponding information. For  example in the question of comparing prices between different EU countries a  link to eurostat will be provided. If the question is what the market share  volatility is, a guidance of what market share volatility is and how it can be  calculated will be provided. The idea is to assist you in finding the  information needed. We will only use publicly available information, such as  eurostat.</p>
