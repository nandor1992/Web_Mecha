                  <p>The  aim of the project is to provide for a widespread, easy to access and to apply  tool for detection of cartels. The issue of the effective detection of the  cartels is in the same time inevitably connected and transformed into the issue  of proving their establishment in (I) administrative procedures and (II) in a  formal legal procedure based on the adversary principle (understood as a  common for the Member States principle that the judgment is reached in the way  of an argument (legal dispute) between opposing parties before a neutral  tribunal, empowered to administer justice, where the parties are under the duty  to substantiate and prove their case in the course of the dispute. As a mirror  rule from the viewpoint of the court: it is not authorised to introduce facts  or evidences in the dispute).</p><br>
                    <p>The  application of the tool before all types of state bodies and bodies of the EU  for the purpose of seizure of legal procedure might result in consequent legal  action by the economical entities identified as forming a cartel.</p><br>
                    <p>In other words, the results provided by or the tool itself  (if we consider the detection as a process performed by the platform) that  facilitates the detection of cartels will principally be capable to be part of  the basis of the administrative decision or of the grounds of the case.</p><br>
                  <p>We have no doubt that the tool might be applied by the  courts and administrative tribunals or other administrative bodies of the  Member States and EU. It will be extremely helpful when proving cartels.  Consequently, the EU citizen will also have an efficient tool of detecting  cartels from a legal point of view.</p><br>

                  <p><strong>The  use of TECOL in Courts</strong></p><br>
                  <p>The  results of TECoL will help the judge to take the decision where there is no  conclusive evidence, i.e. there are some witness evidence stating that there is  an oral agreement but doubts about their correctness exist. This is due to the  fact, that in the civil and in the criminal law it is very hard to find clear  and unambiguous direct evidences, especially where strong economical player  that relay both on highly qualified legal advises and representation as long as  on upon specialized practical and legal experience too, are involved.  Therefore, the judges are usually confined to a line of corroborating  circumstantial evidences, and a strong new one, applicable in every case, as  the suggested is to be welcomed (see Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd v  Commission (case 48/49), where the Court concluded that whilst parallel  behavior (three uniform price increases) does not in itself constitute a  concerted practice it provides strong evidence of such a practice if it leads  to conditions of competition which do not correspond to the normal conditions  of the market; and Shell International Chemical Co. Ltd v Commission (case  T-11/89) where the court held that the factors of a two-thirds share of the  Community market of wood pulp and simultaneously quarterly announced identical  price increases do not constitute concerted practice, since this was a result  of the system of the price announcement, which represented a national response  to the need to limit commercial risk in a long-term market. So, the court found  that the similarity was the result of a high degree of market transparency, and  the parallelism of the price increases could be satisfactorily explained by the  oligopolistic tendencies of the market. On the other hand, the parties&rsquo;  agreement, at meetings within their trade association, to fix recommended  prices and to notify members in advance of any proposed deviation from these  prices was held to restrict competition within the meaning of Art. 85, sec. 1  (now 101, sec. 1). <br>
                    It  might be concluded from the above, that the tool might be effectively used as  an evidence in all types of cartels: by decision, an agreement or collusion,  and will be extremely helpful in cases of collusion where is hardly to be found  a clear and decisive evidences such as the document of the agreement or the  decisions or undisputable witness testimony.</p><br>
