                    <p><strong>Multinational Educational Center of Birmingham - MECB</strong>  is a SME, independent, seeking the active participation of all who share our  interests and goals to inspire the principles and values of freedom, nonviolence,  respect, equality, dignity, communication and promotion of Unity in Diversity.</p><br>
<p>Even  with this various origins and cultures everyone shares the necessity of  mobility in the world we live in, the need to promote some changes in the  relationships between the people and between their membership communities, to  awake in every creature the conscience of the individual power and infinite  possibilities of growth.</p><br>
<p>The main aim of MECB is to  promote the education and development of young people and adults through  activities in formal and non formal education as well as to offer diverse  services thus contributing to human and civil growth at individual, communal  and world levels.</p><br>
<p>MECB has a strong identity, with  solid core values. Yet, we are open to contributions and ideas, especially from  those living closest to the different problems and who would signal the need to  work in a certain direction, corresponding to areas of intervention.</p><br>
<p>We  are trying to achieve our objectives through diverse activities, co-financed by  several institutions and programmes, such as the European Commission, Youth in  Action, Lifelong Learning, Culture, Media, Citizenship or public and private  bodies present in the territory.</p>
