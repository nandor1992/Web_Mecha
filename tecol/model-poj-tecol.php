                    <h5>Dear reader,<br>
                    If from the waterfall of sites in the Internet you chose to open TECOL most probably it is not out of pure curiosity. Most probably you have a reason that will soon make you one of us, one of the TECOL Users.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      So, let us introduce you to the idea of creating and supporting this Tool for Enforcing Competition Law. 
                      
                      As you know around the civilized world fair competition is found to be a basic pre-condition for the development of predictable and prosperous economy i.e. of predictable and prosperous society. 
                      The concentration by itself is not a sinful deed. In the enormously diversified world of contemporary economy there is space designated for the gigantic chains of supermarkets, the local markets, specialized “gourmet shops” etc. The problem appears when the giants start to utilize their advantages so that the market is deprived of its normal characteristics and begins to torment all the parties involved in it.
                      Then monopoly, oligopoly and cartels appear.
                      </h5>
                    <h5>Cartels affect consumers by abnormal prices, dubious quality, falsified ingredients etc. imposed by Masters of the Market not checked by the competition. This leads to high-priced meet, slow and expensive Internet, law quality building materials, etc., etc.  The owners of small and medium enterprises are affected up and down along the chain. 
                      </h5>
                    <h5>And this is here and now.
                      </h5>
                    <h5>Suppressing the brewery of economic, technological and innovational activities – the small and medium enterprises, the cartels are affecting the general public not only as Customers but also as labor force. There is no ground to think that squeezing all sources of a market uncontrolled by competition the cartelized oligopoly is going to compensate somehow the workers that are left unemployed after the collapse of a small competitor or that the oligopoly will have a substantial incentive for enlarging the compensation of its own labor force.    
                      </h5>
                    <h5>Those are just some of the many reasons, formation of cartels is illegal in all countries of the European Union.
                      </h5>
                    <h5>Detection and punishment of cartels is an important objective of competition law enforcement. Facing such problems, the most effective things to do would be to enable the civic society to control the phenomena. Recognizing this EU have passed Regulation 1/2003 under which private entities are encouraged to launch complaints with competition authorities, courts or the Commission should they suspect price fixing or market destructions.<br>
                      <br>
    Generally the formation of cartels is fought by the state authorities. There are commissions, formed by the respective governments. These commissions have large sets of specialized methods, they are authorized to acquire very detailed information, their decisions have lawful effect and can present very strong incentives for the companies to abide the Competition Law.
                      
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      But up till now, as it is largely acknowledged  “most of the detected cartels are found through displeased employees, discriminated customers or a cartel member benefiting from a leniency program”.
                      Until now the general public or if we prefer – the civil society, is left out of the fight against the cartels.
                      But now this is going to change because this is where TECoL and most importantly YOU, dear Reader, come in.
                      Because YOU, dear Reader, can utilize TECoL , find out the probability of a cartel in any market segment and alert the relevant authorities.
                      Because YOU, dear Reader, are the civil society.
                      Because  YOU, dear Reader, are Europe. </h5>
