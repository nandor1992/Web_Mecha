                    <p>Cooperative Speha Fresia is a  training centre engaged in the fields of active policies for the labour market,  local development and research since 1983.</p><br>
<p>The cooperative members believe  in a sustainable, fair and participatory economy, that is focused upon the  person and his/her basic needs and not on individual profit opposed to the  community well-being.</p><br>
<p>The cooperative designs and  realizes integrated interventions of research, training and consultancy  services in line with the principle of mutuality. In its projects, transmitting  opportunity to actively participate in social and economic life, promotes and  practices networking among operators, users, and key players of local  development.</p><br>
<p>The cooperative through all its  activities is in charge to fight against all possible forms of discrimination  based on gender, ethnic origins, sexual orientation, religions in order to valorise  the potential of diversities and to empower individuals through a transcultural  perspective.</p><br>
<p>Speha  Fresia is orientated to innovation and experimentation as process of continuous  search of the quality management and the corporate social responsibility.</p>
