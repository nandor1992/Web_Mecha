                    <p>The  aim of the project is to provide for a widespread, easy to access and to apply  tool for detection of cartels.<br>
                      The  tool will use publicly available databases and will provide objective conclusions  about possible cartels existence, based on mathematical and economical models. </p>
                    <p>The main project objective is to increase  the efficiency of financial investigations through the active involvement of  civil society and individuals.<br>
                      We also aim to encourage horizontal  cooperation, &quot;public-private&quot; partnership between active citizens and  empowered institutions for the prevention of financial crime.<br>
                      To fulfill this aim we created a set of  tools which we named after the project – TECol.</p>
                    <p>TECol is a software, set of web-based  tools, that can potentially turn every European citizen in financial  investigator and facilitate the contact and co-operation between the citizen  and the law enforcing agencies and other interested parties.</p>
                    <p>However, TECOL is just a software – not  very sophisticated, not very mighty, not aiming at detecting or investigating a  cartel. Its target is to serve you. You as a citizen affected by a cartel. You  as a member of civil society concerned about its welfare and its future. <br>
                      It is trying to give some objective grounds  to your experience, to your feeling, to your contemplations regarding a cartel  existing in some market segment.<br>
                      In fact the decisive advantage of TECOL is  that it tries to infuse the blood and spirit of real experience, crucial,  sometimes vital market interaction of real parties of real economic and social  life to the rather cautious and sometimes ambiguous scientific reconstructions.</p>
                    <p>By creating a tool that is easy to use this  project will change this. It will allow the victims actually to help with the  detection of cartels and assist the Authorities in the crime detection phase.  It will allow Regulation 1/2003 to be implemented the way it was meant.</p>
