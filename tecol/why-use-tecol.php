                      <p>Once  established the cartel reveals its ugly face in the tendencies for the future.  Yes, it is true that the concentrated capital can afford the best laboratories  and the best scientists, but the question is what are the incentives for  research and development, for implementation of its achievements in the  technologies of the future? A well developed European country is offering a  surprisingly slow and low quality Internet access in its telecommunications&rsquo;  market. At the same time some of the new EU members can be proud of Internet  access much faster and cheaper offered to their local customers. It is very  difficult to believe that it is a matter of advanced technologies used by the  providers of the latter. Much more logical is to think about the incentives of  the former. Why spend a substantial amount of money on new technologies if the  old ones are still usable and – most important –profitable.  Well there is the little 'thing' – you have  to be sure that none of your competitors will do it.</p>
<p>Once there  is no completion everyone is a loser – the consumer, the economy, the society. <br>
But what  can just an individual citizen do?</p><br>
<p>Realizing how difficult is to be sure about  a cartel structure and, moreover, what a monstrous enemy it can be normally  discourages the normal, everyday people to get involved in something for sure  very difficult and with an unpredictable outcome.</p><br>
<p>Except that… except that we are no longer  in the Dark Ages where monstrous enemies can dissuade us from exposing and  opposing them. The civil society exists.<br>
And through TECoL we have the tool we need  to be able to do 'something'.</p><br>
                      <p>What can be the predictable results of your  (and other people's) engagement with the TECOL Process?</p>
                      <br>
                      <p> The  best, of course is, if it turns out that thanks to your signal, the whole chain  of procedures ends up with the discovery and annihilation of a cartel  structure. Comparable to this, probably, is only the opposite end of the story  – there seem to be no cartel structures on the horizon, these appear to be  normal economical curves or a coincidence of unfavorable tendencies.<br>
                        But,  even if "the happy end" is not exactly at hand the mere presence of the civil  society in the field is <br>
                        <strong>a/</strong> energizing the whole professional  network (something always well-needed)   <br>
                        <strong>b/</strong> creating an additional strong incentive  to abide the Competition Law   <br>
                        <strong>c/</strong> constituting a part of the self  confidence that is so important for the development of the civil society</p><br>
                      <p>We hope to have convinced you that using  TECoL is the rational thing to do. The right thing.</p>
